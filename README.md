# Blind-75 & LeetCode Interview Preparation 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to coding interview problems, primarily based on the [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) and LeetCode 75 study plan. The goal is to master fundamental data structures and algorithms commonly asked in technical interviews.
